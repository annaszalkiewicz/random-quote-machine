## Offline usage

This project use service workers and cache its content. Set up your favorite HTTP server so that a visitor to your site is served index.html, and requests to static paths like /static/js/main.<hash>.js are served with the contents of the /static/js/main.<hash>.js file. Service worker runs only on production `build` directory. If you would like to test it on your local machine, please follow this guide: 

1. Make sure you have installed [Node](https://nodejs.org/).

2. Create `build` folder
```
$ npm run build
```

3. Install [Serve](https://github.com/zeit/serve).
```
$ npm install -g serve
```
4. Serve your static site on the port 5000. 
```
$ serve -s build
```
Like many of serveâ€™s internal settings, the port can be adjusted using the `-p` or `--port` flags.

5. Open project on local server `localhost:5000`
